		<p>Hello. I am Brittney and am commonly associated to Pikachu. I am a college junior and currently studying Computer Science and Engineering. Where? Well... it's a secret~ <br>
		Anyways. I just wanted to share the many interests, hobbies, and fandoms I enjoy here. Gotta have them all in one place to be organized, you know? <br>
		A little about me first. <br>
		I enjoy writing and making up fictional stories, whether its original or based on another work. In the future, I plan to write my own original work! <br>
		Another hobby of mine is drawing. A good portion of the pictures in this website were drawn by me (any that weren't will be sourced accordingly). Although the drawings aren't very good, I strive to be better in the future and enjoy it nonetheless. <br>
		Other hobbies include: singing (not very good but still a fun pastime), gaming, hanging out with friends and family, watching anime, fangirling (o/////o), and listening to music. <br>
